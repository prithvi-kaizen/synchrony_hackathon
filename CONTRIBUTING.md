### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and atomic (one feature/fix per PR)
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure backward compatibility unless it's a breaking change
- Add screenshots for UI changes

## Style Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use strict type checking
- **ESLint**: Follow the configured rules
- **Prettier**: Code formatting is handled automatically
- **File naming**: Use kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports with the `@/` alias

### Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Export components as default exports
- Use `'use client'` directive for client components
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces
- Follow the existing component structure
